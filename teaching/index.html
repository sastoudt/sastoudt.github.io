<br>

STAT 198- Blogging for Data Science</b>

<br>
<br>

Students write 4 posts during the semester related to mathematics, statistics, computer science, and/or data science. Two blog posts can be about anything related to mathematics, statistics, computer science, or data science and are brainstormed using <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2015/01/07/2015-statistics-diary/"> Andrew Gelman’s diary activity </a>  Two blog posts are more technical: a vignette style blog post and a data analysis focused blog post.

<br>

STAT 157- Communicating with Data: The art of writing for data science</b>

<br>
<br>

The old adage, let the data speak for itself, is often poor advice. Without context it can be difficult (even impossible) to glean insights from statistical graphs and tables. In this seminar, students gain experience in how to write about their data insights in a way that is both compelling and faithful to the data. We explore a variety of genres from technical articles to news stories and blog posts.

In the seminar, students explore and analyse data and write about their findings. We also read and review both exemplary published analyses and students’ writing samples. We use modern statistical tools to work in a reproducible environment so that others may follow our decision-making process and recreate our analyses. By the end of the semester, students will have a portfolio of writing samples, including short pieces such as figure captions, Wikipedia entries, blog posts and news stories, and one technical paper.
