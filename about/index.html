			<h1>Sara A. Stoudt</h1>


<p>My name is Sara Stoudt. I am a fourth year student in the <a href="https://statistics.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley Statistics Department</a> and a <a href="https://bids.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Institute for Data Science Fellow</a>. Prior to being a BIDS Fellow, I was supported by a <a href="http://www.npsc.org/"> National Physical Sciences Consortium Fellowship </a> with the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/itl/sed/"> National Institute of Standards and Technology </a> and part of the <a href="http://ds421.berkeley.edu/"> Data Science for the 21st Century: Environment and Society Training Program </a>. 

My research focus is on ecological applications of statistics, and I am advised by <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~wfithian/index.html">Will Fithian</a> and <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/~pdevalpine/">Perry de Valpine</a>. We are currently working on assessing the identifiability and robustness of inference under model misspecification in species distribution models. I am also involved in teaching writing for statistics with Professor Deborah Nolan.



Previously, I received a B.A. in Mathematics from <a href="http://www.math.smith.edu/"> Smith College </a> with an emphasis on <a href="http://smith.edu/statistics/"> Statistics </a>. Ask me about <a href="http://datafest.stat.berkeley.edu"> DataFest </a> or <a href="https://statsbites.wordpress.com/">Statsbites</a>.</p>
