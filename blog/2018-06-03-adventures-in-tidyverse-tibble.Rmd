Note: I'm skipping over purrr until @kellieotto returns from her travels, so we can write our joint post. 

This week's post is on tibbles. This actually came at a perfect time since recently I've run into a few mysteries where I get unexpected errors or output after a data frame gets turned into a tibble at some point during my workflow (like when I use functions from the tidyverse). This is actually a good sign because it means I'm using the tidyverse more in my day to day work. 
So now to solve some tibble troubles.

#### Mystery #1

This mystery comes from Week 7 of Tidy Tuesday, the dreaded barplots. I'm hiding the process code to streamline the post, but if you want to see it, go [here](https://github.com/sastoudt/tidytuesday/blob/master/week7/perceptionsStarWarsWomen.md). The gist of it, is that I want the order of the side by side bars to be consistent within category. 

```{r,echo=F}
setwd("~/Desktop/tidytuesday/data/2018-05-14")
sw=fread("week7_starwars.csv")
realHeader=sw[1,]
sw=sw[-1,]

names(sw)[c(36,38)]=c("householdIncome","location")
names(sw)[2]="seenStarWars"
swYes=subset(sw,seenStarWars=="Yes")

toPlot=swYes[,c("V28","Gender","Age")] 
toPlot=swYes[-which(swYes$Gender==""),c("V28","Gender","Age")]
toPlot=toPlot[-which(toPlot$V28==""),]

## relevel
toPlot$V28=factor(toPlot$V28)
#levels(toPlot$V28)
toPlot$V28=factor(toPlot$V28,levels=levels(toPlot$V28)[c(4,6,3,1,2,5)]) ## GROSS!



byCatGenAge=toPlot %>%group_by(Gender,Age,V28)%>%summarise(count=n())

byGenAge=toPlot %>%group_by(Gender,Age)%>%summarise(count=n())

toPlot=byCatGenAge %>% inner_join(byGenAge,by=c("Gender"="Gender","Age"="Age")) %>% mutate(percent=count.x/count.y)

## get combo
toPlot$genderAge=paste(toPlot$Gender,toPlot$Age) ## is there a less hacky way to do this?
toPlot$genderAge=as.factor(toPlot$genderAge)

## relevel
#levels(toPlot$genderAge)

toPlot$genderAge=factor(toPlot$genderAge,levels=levels(toPlot$genderAge)[c(2,6,3,7,4,8,1,5)]) ## GROSS!

toPlot$Gender=as.factor(toPlot$Gender)
toPlot$Age=as.factor(toPlot$Age)


#levels(toPlot$genderAge) ## fine
#levels(toPlot$Age) ## need to relevel

toPlot$Age=factor(toPlot$Age,levels=levels(toPlot$Age)[c(2,3,4,1)]) ## GROSS!


#toPlot$genderAge=factor(toPlot$genderAge,levels=levels(toPlot$genderAge)[c(2,6,3,7,4,8,1,5)]) ## GROSS!
```

The key is to pre-arrange the data to follow the order that we want to plot it in. 

g1 doesn't work, but g2, g3, and g4 do. 

**Key:** It turns out that the tibble format isn't the issue per se, it is tibble's lazy evaluation (and ggplot's) that is the real issue. This is analogous to why you need `aes_string` instead of `aes` when you are passing in a variable name to ggplot in a custom made function. The rearranging doesn't actually happen until wrapped in another function that evaulates it.

```{r,warning=F,message=F}
toPlot
test=toPlot%>%arrange(Age,V28)
is.tibble(test) 


test2=as.data.frame(toPlot%>%arrange(Age,V28))
test3=data.frame(toPlot%>%arrange(Age,V28))
test4=as.tibble(toPlot%>%arrange(Age,V28))
#test5=tibble(toPlot%>%arrange(Age,V28)) ## Error: Column `toPlot %>% arrange(Age, V28)` must be a 1d atomic vector or a list


g1=ggplot(test,aes(V28,y=percent,fill=genderAge))+geom_bar(stat="identity",position = position_dodge2(preserve = "total"))+theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45,hjust=1))+xlab("")+ggtitle("How do you feel about Padme?")+scale_fill_manual("legend",values=c("Female 18-29"="indianred","Male 18-29"="red","Female 30-44"="dodgerblue","Male 30-44" ="blue","Female 45-60"="green", "Male 45-60"="forestgreen","Female > 60" ="grey","Male > 60" ="black"))


g2=ggplot(test2,aes(V28,y=percent,fill=genderAge))+geom_bar(stat="identity",position = position_dodge2(preserve = "total"))+theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45,hjust=1))+xlab("")+ggtitle("How do you feel about Padme?")+scale_fill_manual("legend",values=c("Female 18-29"="indianred","Male 18-29"="red","Female 30-44"="dodgerblue","Male 30-44" ="blue","Female 45-60"="green", "Male 45-60"="forestgreen","Female > 60" ="grey","Male > 60" ="black"))

g3=ggplot(test3,aes(V28,y=percent,fill=genderAge))+geom_bar(stat="identity",position = position_dodge2(preserve = "total"))+theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45,hjust=1))+xlab("")+ggtitle("How do you feel about Padme?")+scale_fill_manual("legend",values=c("Female 18-29"="indianred","Male 18-29"="red","Female 30-44"="dodgerblue","Male 30-44" ="blue","Female 45-60"="green", "Male 45-60"="forestgreen","Female > 60" ="grey","Male > 60" ="black"))

g4=ggplot(test4,aes(V28,y=percent,fill=genderAge))+geom_bar(stat="identity",position = position_dodge2(preserve = "total"))+theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45,hjust=1))+xlab("")+ggtitle("How do you feel about Padme?")+scale_fill_manual("legend",values=c("Female 18-29"="indianred","Male 18-29"="red","Female 30-44"="dodgerblue","Male 30-44" ="blue","Female 45-60"="green", "Male 45-60"="forestgreen","Female > 60" ="grey","Male > 60" ="black"))

#### Mystery #2

This mystery comes from a scenario at work. I had one dataset that had different states than another dataset (state was treated as a factor). I wanted to find new levels and replace them with a catch all "other" level. I started with a data frame, but I used `complete` from tidyr at some point, and unknowingly had switched to a tibble. Therefore, my subsetting procedure was not doing what I expected. Here is a simplified example:

```{r}
state=tibble(state=as.factor(c("AL","AK","AR","AS")))
state2=tibble(state=as.factor(c("AL","AK","AR","AS","CA","CO")))
```

What I did:

```{r}
state2[,1] %in% levels(state[,1])
levels(state[,1])
```

What I should have did given that I'm working with tibbles:


```{r}
test=state2[[1]] %in% levels(state[[1]])
test
```

**Key**: subsetting tibbles by column requires the double brackets 

What I did:

```{r}
state2[,1]=as.character(state2[,1])
state2
```

What I should have did given that I'm working with tibbles:

**Key**: again this is a subsetting syntax issue

```{r}
state2=tibble(state=as.factor(c("AL","AK","AR","AS","CA","CO")))

state2[[1]]=as.character(state2[[1]])
state2[test,1]<-"other"
```

Compare to behavior on a dataframe (this is the output I expected):

```{r}
state=data.frame(state=as.factor(c("AL","AK","AR","AS")))
state2=data.frame(state=as.factor(c("AL","AK","AR","AS","CA","CO")))

state2[,1] %in% levels(state[,1])
levels(state[,1])

state2[,1]=as.character(state2[,1])
state2

state2[test,1]<-"other"
state2
state2
```

#### Mystery #3

This mystery comes from my [readr post](https://sastoudt.github.io/blog/2018/05/26/adventures-in-tidyverse-readr) where I wanted to remove rows that had NAs in certain columns and a certain number of characters in another example. Here is a simplified example: 

```{r}
tb=tibble(x=c(NA,NA,3),y=c(NA,2,1),z=c("A","BC","D"))
tb[,1] ## tibble
tb[[1]] ## vector
```

The difference in subsetting syntax is a reoccurring issue. I use the syntax expecting my data to be a dataframe, but I forgot that tidyverse functions switch to tibbles.

```{r}
tb[-which(is.na(tb[,2]) & is.na(tb[,1]) & nchar(tb[,3])<=1),]
```

Weird! I expected the output to remove the first row. What's going on?

```{r}
is.na(tb[,2])
is.na(tb[,1]) 
```

These are fine.

```{r}
nchar(tb[,3])<=1
nchar(tb[,3])
```

Ah, here is the culprit! Switching to tibble subsetting syntax...

```{r}
nchar(tb[[3]])<=1
```

Much better.

Original:

```{r}
is.na(tb[,2]) & is.na(tb[,1])  &nchar(tb[,3])<=1
```

Fix:

```{r}
is.na(tb[,2]) & is.na(tb[,1])  &nchar(tb[[3]])<=1
tb[-which(is.na(tb[,2]) & is.na(tb[,1]) & nchar(tb[[3]])<=1),]
```

Compare to behavior on a dataframe:

```{r}
tb=tibble(x=c(NA,NA,3),y=c(NA,2,1),z=c("A","BC","D"))
tb2=as.data.frame(tb)

tb2[-which(is.na(tb2[,2]) & is.na(tb2[,1]) & nchar(tb2[,3])<=1),]
```

This is the output I expected.

```{r}
is.na(tb2[,2])
is.na(tb2[,1]) 
nchar(tb2[,3])<=1
```

The double bracket subsetting also works:

```{r}
is.na(tb2[[2]])
is.na(tb2[[1]]) 
nchar(tb2[[3]])<=1
```

```{r}
is.na(tb2[,2]) & is.na(tb2[,1])  &nchar(tb2[,3])<=1
is.na(tb2[[2]]) & is.na(tb2[[1]])  &nchar(tb2[[3]])<=1
```

**Take-Away:** The unexpected behavior that led to most of these mysteries turned out to be because I was using the wrong subsetting syntax.

Since the double bracket subsetting works for dataframes and tibbles, I should transition to using this syntax so that I am not surprised by output when a tibble gets thrown into the mix.
