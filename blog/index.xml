      <description>I signed up to get Dan Kopf’s “Golden Stats Warrior” newsletter, a newsletter that provides data driven insight into the Bay Area. You can sign up too here.
The last edition looked at the greatest albums from the Bay Area. Of albums by Bay Area natives, which ones got five stars on AllMusic? Being a bit of a music nerd, I wanted to dig in further. Kopf was kind enough to share the data with me so that I could do some more exploring.</description>

      <title>Songs to Strut To</title>

      <description>library(billboard) library(dplyr) library(kableExtra) I watched Saturday Night Fever in preparation for my blog post about its soundtrack on CoverMeSongs. The opening scene shows John Travolta marching down the street to the Bee Gees’s “Stayin Alive.’”
I learned that this song is also used to help people practice CPR because it has the correct tempo for recommended compressions. This made me wonder more about the tempo of the song. Would a New Yorker really walk along at that pace?</description>
