      <description>My name is Sara Stoudt. I am a fifth year student in the UC Berkeley Statistics Department and a Berkeley Institute for Data Science Fellow. Prior to being a BIDS Fellow, I was supported by a National Physical Sciences Consortium Fellowship  with the National Institute of Standards and Technology  and part of the Data Science for the 21st Century: Environment and Society Training Program .
My research focus is on ecological applications of statistics, and I am advised by Will Fithian and Perry de Valpine.</description>
