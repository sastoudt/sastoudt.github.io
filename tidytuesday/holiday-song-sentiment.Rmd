Let's see how basic sentiment analysis classifies these Christmas hits. Luckily, I already have this code ready to go from my [R Ladies Lightning Talk](https://github.com/sastoudt/groove_is_in_the_heart_and_data/blob/master/4_lyrics_Nice.R).

```{r,warning=F}
allSentiment <- sentiment(lyrics$lyric)

lyrics$id <- 1:nrow(lyrics)

lyrics2 <- merge(allSentiment, lyrics, by.x = "element_id", by.y = "id")
```

## Top 5 Most Positive Songs (on average across lyric lines)

```{r}
tt <- lyrics2 %>% group_by(track_title) %>% summarise(meanSentiment = mean(sentiment)) %>% arrange(desc(meanSentiment)) %>% head(5)

kable(tt) %>% kable_styling()
```

## Top 5 Most Negative Songs (on average across lyric lines)

```{r}
tt <- lyrics2 %>% group_by(track_title) %>% summarise(meanSentiment = mean(sentiment)) %>% arrange(meanSentiment) %>% head(5)

kable(tt) %>% kable_styling()
```

## Distribution of Sentiment

There is a big peak at zero and then plenty of positive sentiment songs, but I would have expected more. However, this is just some basic analysis, so a more sophisticated approach might yield more like we expect.

```{r,warning=F, message=F}
lyrics3 <- lyrics2 %>% group_by(track_title) %>% summarise(meanSentiment = mean(sentiment))

ggplot(lyrics3, aes(meanSentiment)) + geom_histogram() + theme_minimal()
```

## What makes Mr. Grinch so negative?

```{r}
tt <- lyrics2 %>% filter(track_title == "You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch") %>% select(sentiment, lyric) %>% arrange(sentiment) %>% head(5)

kable(tt) %>% kable_styling()
```

What makes "Silent Night" so positive? Repetition! Free idea: analyze the [repetition](https://sastoudt.github.io/blog/2018-03-27-song-repetition-analysis/) of the holiday hits.

```{r}
tt <- lyrics2 %>% filter(track_title == "Silent Night") %>% select(sentiment, lyric) %>% arrange(desc(sentiment)) %>% head(5)

kable(tt) %>% kable_styling()
```

Now let's compare these songs to the songs on the Stoudt Christmas CD. This CD was lovingly curated by my dad, and I have listened to it every Christmas that I can remember, from in the car driving across Pennsylvania to see family to while decorating the tree. This year I don't get to hear it played from the real CD at home, so I had to make a Spotify version. Check it out [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0bso6lvKInn3myZ65vCSyj?si=DcD0IBwSS6eyZcdgUFM49w). Usually I'm all for a good shuffled playlist, but this one has to be listened to in order, because TRADITION. 

As soon as I hear those opening lines of Paul McCartney's "Wonderful Christmastime" I know it's holiday time!

```{r}
blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "94Ye-3C1FC8")
```


```{r,eval = F}
spotify_client_id <- "" ## put yours here
spotify_client_secret <- "" ## put yours here
access_token <- get_spotify_access_token(client_id = spotify_client_id, client_secret = spotify_client_secret)
```

```{r,eval = F}
stoudtChristmas <- get_playlist_tracks("0bso6lvKInn3myZ65vCSyj", authorization = access_token)
```

```{r,eval=F}
safe_lyrics <- safely(genius_lyrics)

artists <- unlist(lapply(stoudtChristmas$track.artists, function(x) {
  x[1, "name"]
}))
track_name <- stoudtChristmas$track.name

lyricsStoudt <- mapply(safe_lyrics, artists, track_name, SIMPLIFY = F)

didItWork <- lapply(lyricsStoudt, function(x) {
  x$error
})

sum(unlist(lapply(didItWork, is.null))) ## 14 of 21 have lyrics
setwd("~/Desktop/tidytuesday/week52_2019")
save(lyricsStoudt, file = "lyricsStoudtChristmas.RData")
```

Unfortunately, this Bruce classic got dropped.

```{r}
blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "76WFkKp8Tjs")
```

```{r}
setwd("~/Desktop/tidytuesday/week52_2019")
load(file = "lyricsStoudtChristmas.RData")

test <- lapply(lyricsStoudt, function(x) {
  x$result
})

allL <- do.call("rbind", test)

allSentiment <- sentiment(allL$lyric)

allL$id <- 1:nrow(allL)

allL2 <- merge(allSentiment, allL, by.x = "element_id", by.y = "id")
```

## Top 5 Most Positive Songs (on average across lyric lines)

```{r}
tt <- allL2 %>% group_by(track_title) %>% summarise(meanSentiment = mean(sentiment)) %>% arrange(desc(meanSentiment)) %>% head(5)

kable(tt) %>% kable_styling()
```

## Top 5 Most Negative Songs (on average across lyric lines)

```{r}
tt <- allL2 %>% group_by(track_title) %>% summarise(meanSentiment = mean(sentiment)) %>% arrange(meanSentiment) %>% head(5)

kable(tt) %>% kable_styling()
```

How does the Stoudt family Christmas album compare? We're pretty positive (in red) in comparison to all of the hits.

```{r,warning=F, message=F}
allL3 <- allL2 %>% group_by(track_title) %>% summarise(meanSentiment = mean(sentiment))

ggplot(lyrics3, aes(meanSentiment)) + geom_histogram() + theme_minimal() + geom_histogram(data = allL3, aes(meanSentiment), fill = "red")
```

Happy Holidays!
