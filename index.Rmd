My name is Sara Stoudt, and I use she/her pronouns. I am an Assistant Professor at Bucknell University in the Mathematics Department. I received my PhD in statistics from the University of California, Berkeley where I was also a [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu/) Fellow. My research focus is on ecological applications of statistics and statistics communication. At Berkeley I was advised by Will Fithian and Perry de Valpine and taught writing for statistics with Deb Nolan. Previously, I received a B.A. in Mathematics from Smith College with an emphasis on Statistics. Check out Deborah Nolan and my book, ["Communicating with Data: The Art of Writing for Data Science"](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/communicating-with-data-9780198862758?cc=us&lang=en&") with companion website [here](https://communicating-with-data.github.io/), the [Data Science by Design "Our Environment" Anthology](https://datasciencebydesign.org/book-2), and the [Data Science by Design "Future of Data Science" Anthology](https://datasciencebydesign.org/book).
