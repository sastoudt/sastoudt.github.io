My name is Sara Stoudt, and I use she/her pronouns. I am an Assistant Professor at Bucknell University in the Mathematics Department. I received my PhD in statistics from the University of California, Berkeley where I was also a [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu/) Fellow. My research focus is on ecological applications of statistics and statistics communication. At Berkeley I was advised by Will Fithian and Perry de Valpine and taught writing for statistics with Deb Nolan. Previously, I received a B.A. in Mathematics from Smith College with an emphasis on Statistics. Check out Deborah Nolan and my new book, ["Communicating with Data: The Art of Writing for Data Science"](https://twitter.com/sastoudt/status/1390675020209340420?s=20")
